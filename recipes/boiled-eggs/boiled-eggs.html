   <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>
      Perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. While you do not taste the vinegar or <br>
      salt, they both pull the skin from the eggshell so it peels easily without <br>
      tearing or sticking. I have been making them this way for years. Family <br>
      members call them "Ken's Eggs."
