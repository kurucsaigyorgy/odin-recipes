   <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>
      Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, <br>
      then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container. <br>
      Store in the refrigerator for up to four days. <br>
      Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.
   </p>
   <p>
      If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. <br>
      Allow it to cool completely, then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap. <br>
      Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil. <br>
      Freeze for up to three months. <br>
      Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or microwave.

         <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
         <li>3 large eggs</li>

         <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
         <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      </ul>

   <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high <br>
            heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion <br>
            and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
         </li><br>
         <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, <br>
            basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, <br>
            stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
         </li><br>
         <li>
            While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a <br>
            boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until <br>
            tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

         </li><br>
         <li>
            While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
         </li><br>
         <li>
            Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh <br>
            parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
         </li><br>
         <li>
            Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a <br>
            9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over <br>
            the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining <br>
            sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using <br>
            the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the <br>
            baking dish with aluminum foil.
         </li><br>
         <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake <br>
            until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
         </li><br>
         <li>
            Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
         </li>
      </ol>
